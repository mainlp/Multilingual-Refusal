2025-01-06:01:35:23,882 INFO     [modeling.py:1008] We will use 90% of the memory on device 0 for storing the model, and 10% for the buffer to avoid OOM. You can set `max_memory` in to a higher value to use more memory (at your own risk).
We detected that you are passing `past_key_values` as a tuple and this is deprecated and will be removed in v4.43. Please use an appropriate `Cache` class (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.41.3/en/internal/generation_utils#transformers.Cache)
